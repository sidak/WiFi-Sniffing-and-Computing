#Packet Sniffing and Distributed Computing tools for WiFi

##WiFi Packet Sniffing

This tool is an adaptive packet sniffer that changes channels 
on the basis of of frequency of packets captured and redistributes the time for
each channel accordingly. Further, with ever increasing dependence on wireless solutions,
knowing the devices can prove to be very useful.

It displays statistics for each packet captured as well as per-minute statistics for each MAC Address.

##WiFi Distributed Computing
This tool helps in the distributed computing of mathematical expressions contained
in packets captured over WiFi. The client sends some fixed number of packets containing mathematical expressions,
and is acknowledged by server when it captures one of these packets.
The server then computes this expression by first converting into postfix and similarly sends some fixed
amount of packets containing the answer. The client captures them and then sends the final acknowledgement to the server.
